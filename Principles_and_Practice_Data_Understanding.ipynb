Note: An important life style factor to measure the fitness level: how active the members were ? is not among the attributes. But some preliminary analysis revealed that the hobbies mentioned in the essay text can help us extract a new feature \"isActive\". But thats a NLP task and out of scope for the current chapter.\n",
